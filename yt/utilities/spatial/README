This directory is a modified version of the same directory that is part of
the scipy.spatial package. It has been modified by me in the following
ways:

- In ckdtree.pyx, distances and searches over the
  tree both take periodic boundary
  conditions into account.

- In ckdtree.pyx, all input and output arrays now
  use 64-bit types: long and double.

- In ckdtree.pyx, I've added two functions specifically for parallel HOP,
  chainHOP_get_dens and find_chunk_nearest_neighbors.

- In kdtree.py, I've commented out 'import scipy.sparse',
  which means that any kdtree functionality that uses sparse
  will not work. This is to avoid needing to build the rest
  of scipy, which is a challenge and not necessary for just
  the kdtree.

- I've removed all of the qhull source and functionality.

- I've removed the 'tests' directory.

- I've removed anything having to do with Bento, the
  python package manager.

Anything that has been removed can be found in the original scipy
source distribution.
