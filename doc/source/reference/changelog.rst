The `CREDITS file <http://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/src/yt/CREDITS>`_ contains the
most up-to-date list of everyone who has contributed to the yt source code.

Version 3.2
-----------

Major enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Particle-Only Plots - a series of new plotting functions for visualizing
  particle data.  See here for more information.
* Late-stage beta support for Python 3 - unit tests and answer tests pass for
  all the major frontends under python 3.4, and yt should now be mostly if not
  fully usable.  Because many of the yt developers are still on Python 2 at
  this point, this should be considered a "late stage beta" as there may be
  remaining issues yet to be identified or worked out.
* Now supporting Gadget Friend-of-Friends/Subfind catalogs - see here to learn
  how to load halo catalogs as regular yt datasets.
* Custom colormaps can now be easily defined and added - see here to learn how!
* Now supporting Fargo3D data
* Performance improvements throughout the code base for memory and speed

Version 3.0
-----------

This release of yt features an entirely rewritten infrastructure for
data ingestion, indexing, and representation.  While past versions of
yt were focused on analysis and visualization of data structured as
regular grids, this release features full support for particle
(discrete point) data such as N-body and SPH data, irregular
hexahedral mesh data, and data organized via octrees.  This
infrastructure will be extended in future versions for high-fidelity
representation of unstructured mesh datasets.

Highlighted changes in yt 3.0:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Units now permeate the code base, enabling self-consistent unit
   transformations of all arrays and quantities returned by yt.
 * Particle data is now supported using a lightweight octree.  SPH
   data can be smoothed onto an adaptively-defined mesh using standard
   SPH smoothing
 * Support for octree AMR codes
 * Preliminary Support for non-Cartesian data, such as cylindrical,
   spherical, and geographical
 * Revamped analysis framework for halos and halo catalogs, including
   direct ingestion and analysis of halo catalogs of several different
   formats
 * Support for multi-fluid datasets and datasets containing multiple
   particle types
 * Flexible support for dynamically defining new particle types using
   filters on existing particle types or by combining different particle
   types.
 * Vastly improved support for loading generic grid, AMR, hexahedral
   mesh, and particle without hand-coding a frontend for a particular
   data format.
 * New frontends for ART, ARTIO, Boxlib, Chombo, FITS, GDF, Subfind,
   Rockstar, Pluto, RAMSES, SDF, Gadget, OWLS, PyNE, Tipsy, as well as
   rewritten frontends for Enzo, FLASH, Athena, and generic data.
 * First release to support installation of yt on Windows
 * Extended capabilities for construction of simulated observations,
   and new facilities for analyzing and visualizing FITS images and cube
   data
 * Many performance improvements

This release is the first of several; while most functionality from
the previous generation of yt has been updated to work with yt 3.0, it
does not yet have feature parity in all respects.  While the core of
yt is stable, we suggest the support for analysis modules and volume
rendering be viewed as a late-stage beta, with a series of additional
releases (3.1, 3.2, etc) appearing over the course of the next year to
improve support in these areas.

For a description of how to bring your 2.x scripts up to date to 3.0,
and a summary of common gotchas in this transition, please see
:ref:`yt3differences`.

Version 2.5
-----------

Many below-the-surface changes happened in yt 2.5 to improve reliability,
fidelity of the answers, and streamlined user interface.  The major change in
this release has been the immense expansion in testing of yt.  We now have over
2000 unit tests (run on every commit, thanks to both Kacper Kowalik and Shining
Panda) as well as answer testing for FLASH, Enzo, Chombo and Orion data.

The Stream frontend, which can construct datasets in memory, has been improved
considerably.  It's now easier than ever to load data from disk.  If you know
how to get volumetric data into Python, you can use either the
``load_uniform_grid`` function or the ``load_amr_grid`` function to create an
in-memory dataset that yt can analyze.

yt now supports the Athena code.

yt is now focusing on providing first class support for the IPython notebook.
In this release, plots can be displayed inline.  The Reason HTML5 GUI will be
merged with the IPython notebook in a future release.

Install Script Changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * SciPy can now be installed
 * Rockstar can now be installed
 * Dependencies can be updated with "yt update --all"
 * Cython has been upgraded to 0.17.1
 * Python has been upgraded to 2.7.3
 * h5py has been upgraded to 2.1.0
 * hdf5 has been upgraded to 1.8.9
 * matplotlib has been upgraded to 1.2.0
 * IPython has been upgraded to 0.13.1
 * Forthon has been upgraded to 0.8.10
 * nose has been added
 * sympy has been added
 * python-hglib has been added

We've also improved support for installing on OSX, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE.

Most Visible Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Nearly 200 pull requests and over 1000 changesets have been merged since yt
   2.4 was release on August 2nd, 2012.
 * numpy is now imported as np, not na.  na will continue to work for the
   foreseeable future.
 * You can now get a `yt cheat sheet <http://yt-project.org/docs/2.5/cheatsheet.pdf>`!
 * yt can now load simulation data created by Athena.
 * The Rockstar halo finder can now be installed by the install script
 * SciPy can now be installed by the install script
 * Data can now be written out in two ways:

   * Sidecar files containing expensive derived fields can be written and
     implicitly loaded from.
   * GDF files, which are portable yt-specific representations of full
     simulations, can be created from any dataset.  Work is underway on
     a pure C library that can be linked against to load these files into
     simulations.

 * The "Stream" frontend, for loading raw data in memory, has been greatly
   expanded and now includes initial conditions generation functionality,
   particle fields, and simple loading of AMR grids with ``load_amr_grids``.
 * Spherical and Cylindrical fields have been sped up and made to have a
   uniform interface.  These fields can be the building blocks of more advanced
   fields.
 * Coordinate transformations have been sped up and streamlined. It is now
   possible to convert any scalar or vector field to a new cartesian, spherical,
   or cylindrical coordinate system with an arbitrary orientation. This makes it
   possible to do novel analyses like profiling the toroidal and poloidal
   velocity as a function of radius in an inclined disk.
 * Many improvements to the EnzoSimulation class, which can now find many
   different types of data.
 * Image data is now encapsulated in an ImageArray class, which carries with it
   provenance information about its trajectory through yt.
 * Streamlines now query at every step along the streamline, not just at every
   cell.
 * Surfaces can now be extracted and examined, as well as uploaded to
   Sketchfab.com for interactive visualization in a web browser.
 * allsky_projection can now accept a datasource, making it easier to cut out
   regions to examine.
 * Many, many improvements to PlotWindow.  If you're still using
   PlotCollection, check out ``ProjectionPlot``, ``SlicePlot``,
   ``OffAxisProjectionPlot`` and ``OffAxisSlicePlot``.
 * PlotWindow can now accept a timeseries instead of a dataset.
 * Many fixes for 1D and 2D data, especially in FLASH datasets.
 * Vast improvements to the particle file handling for FLASH datasets.
 * Particles can now be created ex nihilo with CICSample_3.
 * Rockstar halo finding is now a targeted goal.  Support for using Rockstar
   has improved dramatically.
 * Increased support for tracking halos across time using the FOF halo finder.
 * The command ``yt notebook`` has been added to spawn an IPython notebook
   server, and the ``yt.imods`` module can replace ``yt.mods`` in the IPython
   Notebook to enable better integration.
 * Metallicity-dependent X-ray fields have now been added.
 * Grid lines can now be added to volume renderings.
 * Volume rendering backend has been updated to use an alpha channel, fixing
   parallel opaque volume renderings.  This also enables easier blending of
   multiple images and annotations to the rendering. Users are encouraged
   to look at the capabilities of the ``ImageArray`` for writing out renders,
   as updated in the cookbook examples. Volume renders can now be saved with
   an arbitrary background color.
 * Periodicity, or alternately non-periodicity, is now a part of radius
   calculations.
 * The AMRKDTree has been rewritten.  This allows parallelism with other than
   power-of-2 MPI processes, arbitrary sets of grids, and splitting of
   unigrids.
 * Fixed Resolution Buffers and volume rendering images now utilize a new
   ImageArray class that stores information such as data source, field names,
   and other information in a .info dictionary. See the ``ImageArray``
   docstrings for more information on how they can be used to save to a bitmap
   or hdf5 file.

Version 2.4
-----------

The 2.4 release was particularly large, encompassing nearly a thousand
changesets and a number of new features.

To help you get up to speed, we've made an IPython notebook file demonstrating
