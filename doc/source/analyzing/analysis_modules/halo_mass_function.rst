Halo Mass Function
==================

The Halo Mass Function extension is capable of outputting the halo mass function
for a collection halos (input), and/or an analytical fit over a given mass range
for a set of specified cosmological parameters.
This extension is based on code generously provided by Brian O'Shea.

General Overview
----------------

A halo mass function can be created for the halos identified in a cosmological
simulation, as well as analytic fits using any arbitrary set of cosmological
parameters. In order to create a mass function for simulated halos, they must
first be identified (using HOP, FOF, or Rockstar, see
:ref:`halo_catalog`) and loaded as a halo dataset object. The distribution of
halo masses will then be found, and can be compared to the analytic prediction
at the same redshift and using the same cosmological parameters as were used
in the simulation. Care should be taken in this regard, as the analytic fit
requires the specification of cosmological parameters that are not necessarily
stored in the halo or simulation datasets, and must be specified by the user.
Efforts have been made to set reasonable defaults for these parameters, but
setting them to identically match those used in the simulation will produce a
much better comparison.

Analytic halo mass functions can also be created without a halo dataset by
providing either a simulation dataset or specifying cosmological parameters by
hand. yt includes 5 analytic fits for the halo mass function which can be
selected.


Analytical Fits
---------------

There are five analytical fits to choose from.

  1. `Press-Schechter (1974) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P>`_
  2. `Jenkins (2001) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.321..372J>`_
  3. `Sheth-Tormen (2002) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.329...61S>`_
  4. `Warren (2006) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...646..881W>`_
  5. `Tinker (2008) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...688..709T>`_

We encourage reading each of the primary sources.
In general, we recommend the Warren fitting function because it matches
simulations over a wide range of masses very well.
The Warren fitting function is the default (equivalent to not specifying
``fitting_function`` in ``HaloMassFcn()``, below).
The Tinker fit is for the :math:`\Delta=300` fits given in the paper, which
appears to fit HOP threshold=80.0 fairly well.


Basic Halo Mass Function Creation
---------------------------------

The simplest way to create a halo mass function object is to simply pass it no
arguments and let it use the default cosmological parameters.

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.analysis_modules.halo_mass_function.api import *

  hmf = HaloMassFcn()

This will create a HaloMassFcn object off of which arrays holding the information
about the analytic mass function hang. Creating the halo mass function for a set
of simulated halos requires only the loaded halo dataset to be passed as an
argument. This also creates the analytic mass function using all parameters that
can be extracted from the halo dataset, at the same redshift, spanning a similar
range of halo masses.

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.mods import *
  from yt.analysis_modules.halo_mass_function.api import *

  my_halos = load("rockstar_halos/halos_0.0.bin")
  hmf = HaloMassFcn(halos_ds=my_halos)

A simulation dataset can be passed along with additional cosmological parameters
to create an analytic mass function.

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.mods import *
  from yt.analysis_modules.halo_mass_function.api import *

  my_ds = load("RD0027/RedshiftOutput0027")
  hmf = HaloMassFcn(simulation_ds=my_ds, omega_baryon0=0.05, primordial_index=0.96,
                    sigma8 = 0.8, log_mass_min=5, log_mass_max=9)

The analytic mass function can be created for a set of arbitrary cosmological
parameters without any dataset being passed as an argument.

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.mods import *
  from yt.analysis_modules.halo_mass_function.api import *

  hmf = HaloMassFcn(omega_baryon0=0.05, omega_matter0=0.27,
                    omega_lambda0=0.73, hubble0=0.7, this_redshift=10,
                    log_mass_min=5, log_mass_max=9, fitting_function=5)

Keyword Arguments
-----------------

* **simulation_ds** (*Simulation dataset object*)
  The loaded simulation dataset, used to set cosmological parameters.
  Default : None.

* **halos_ds** (*Halo dataset object*)
  The halos from a simulation to be used for creation of the
  halo mass function in the simulation.
  Default : None.

  the simulated halo mass function.  Automatically set to true if a
  simulation dataset is provided.

Outputs
-------

A HaloMassFnc object has several arrays hanging off of it containing the

* **masses_sim**: Halo masses from simulated halos. Units: M_solar

* **n_cumulative_sim**: Number density of halos with mass greater than the
  corresponding mass in masses_sim. Units: comoving Mpc^-3

* **masses_analytic**: Masses used for the generation of the analytic mass
  function. Units: M_solar

* **n_cumulative_analytic**: Number density of halos with mass greater then
  the corresponding mass in masses_analytic. Units: comoving Mpc^-3

* **dndM_dM_analytic**: Differential number density of halos, (dn/dM)*dM.

After the mass function has been created for both simulated halos and the
corresponding analytic fits, they can be plotted though something along the
lines of

.. code-block:: python

  import yt
  from yt.analysis_modules.halo_mass_function.api import *
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  my_halos = yt.load("rockstar_halos/halos_0.0.bin")
  hmf = HaloMassFcn(halos_ds=my_halos)

  plt.loglog(hmf.masses_sim, hmf.n_cumulative_sim)
  plt.loglog(hmf.masses_analytic, hmf.n_cumulative_analytic)

Attached to ``hmf`` is the convenience function ``write_out``, which saves the
halo mass function to a text file. (continued from above)
.. code-block:: python

  hmf.write_out(prefix='hmf', analytic=True, simulated=True)

This writes the files ``hmf-analytic.dat`` with columns:

* mass [Msun]
* cumulative number density of halos [comoving Mpc^-3]
* (dn/dM)*dM (differential number density of halos) [comoving Mpc^-3]

and the file ``hmf-simulated.dat`` with columns:

* mass [Msun]
* cumulative number density of halos [comoving Mpc^-3]
